# espaceGG
web scraping  and data ingestion project

In this project we scrape a radio brodcast data using the brodcast hashtag on twitter (espaceGG or espacegg)
then we created a csv file and uploaded it in postgreSQL using python sqlalchemy library. Finally we analysed it
making a visualization with PowerBI.
