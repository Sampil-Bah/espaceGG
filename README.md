# espaceGG
web scraping, data ingestion and visualization project

In this project we scrape a radio broadcast data using the brodcast hashtag on twitter (espaceGG or espacegg)
then we created a csv file and uploaded it in postgreSQL using python sqlalchemy library. Finally we imported the data from postgres and analysed it
making a visualization with PowerBI.
